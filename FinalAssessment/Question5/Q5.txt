QUESTION A

The program to handle the connections between movies, actors, and movie roles will be implemented by using and modifying Q5Graph.py.
First the file reading methods must be implemented, paying detail to the format of the input file and populating the Graph correctly.
The code will require modification to better identify between movies, actors, and roles as they are separate entities that interact with eachother.
The later display methods in (c) will rely on the connections between objects (edges between vertices in a graph), output results based on their connections from the weighted matrix.

QUESTION B 

Documentation:
- GraphNode sub class and constructor added to provide each object class fields, giving unique attributes
- GraphNode objects have a label, and type 
- minor modfications due to sub class implementation e.g addVertex now creates GraphNode object rather than storing an int or storing
- extra functionalities for usability and efficiency - getEdge, hasEdge
- file reading features, display methods for movies, actors, and roles

QUESTION C 

Documentation:
- implemented displayActorsMovies, displayMovieActors
- added size parameter for Graph constructor, allowing size to be intialized upon creating Graph object
- tested outputs using both the custom sample data file, and provided file
- implemented displayCostars, no  indentation
- ****updated*** indentation done
